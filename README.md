# Scrabble-Arduino-Uno
This project is a virtual but a more fun version of the famous Scrabble game. This game will generate
a random set of letters, and persons must come up with as many words from them as possible. It will 
involve two types of rounds. One is a regular round where both have the chance to enter their words 
but under a certain amount of time to check their speed and analysis of the letters given and it 
calculate both players' points. The bonus rounds will allow them to compete even more with each 
other as whoever figures out the word first wins. This is a fun and entertaining game used for 
relaxation, interacting more with friends, and expanding on one's vocabulary. This game could be 
possibly used and adapted to make an online version multiplayer game to allow friends to play even 
when they are not physically close, and it can also be used as a vocabulary fun game for middle 
school students in English classes.
